# Dibimbing Assignment: Breast Cancer Classification
# Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of tumors can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project utilizes a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on various features obtained from a breast cancer dataset.

In this project, I use the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble method, to build the predictive model.

# Insight
1. The Random Forest classifier demonstrated high performance with an accuracy of around 96%.
2. Precision and recall for both classes (benign and malignant) showed strong performance, though some room for improvement exists in minimizing False Negatives (tumor misclassified as benign).

# Adivce
1. Explore other algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
2. Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling/oversampling.
